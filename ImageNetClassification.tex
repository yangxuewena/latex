 Our network achieves top-1 and top-5 test set error rates of 37.5\% and 17.0\%. The best performance achieved during the ILSVRC-2010 competition was 47.1\% and 28.2\% with an approach that averages the predictions produced from six sparse-coding models trained on different features , and since then the best published results are 45.7\% and 25.7\% with an approach that averages the predictions of two classi-fiers trained on Fisher Vectors (FVs) computed from two types of densely-sampled features.

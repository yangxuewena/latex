\maketitle
After watching the film A.I.I find it is a very good film and I very like it."AI" is a very personal film, a deeply moving, scientific, careful, and harrowing motion picture that displays startling talent on screen and behind the scenes.

Artificial intelligence can benefit mankind in many fields,such as treatment of diseases, industrial production and large data calculation.As for Google ¡¯s AlphaGo,it has achieved great progress and this progress could be revolutionary.Artificial intelligence also have the positive side, they won't be tired and food and water become unnecessary,they work by electricity. But we should understand that the advantages should not be abused,if so,there will be an unpredictable ending.
To make a long story short,artificial intelligence will become our "invisible assistant" rather than our competitors in within a period of time,we should cooperate fully with artificial intelligence,using it appropriately is the right way in my mind.

 I saw this film with my brother who's first word when the film ended was "Wow!" He only expresses that for films he really likes.Those who like science fiction and those who like films that make them think definitely see this film.Even if you are not as impressed as I am you will find parts of the film fascinating.

\title{Five Disruptive Technology Directions for 5G}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
5G is coming. What technologies will define it? Will 5G be just an evolution of 4G, or will emerging technologies cause a disruption requiring a wholesale rethinking of entrenched cellular principles? This paper focuses on potential disruptive technologies and their implications for 5G.
We classify the impact of new technologies, leveraging the Henderson-Clark model, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item[1)]
Minor changes at both the node and the architectural level, e.g., the introduction of codebooks and signaling support for a higher number of antennas. We refer to these as evolutions in the design.
\item[2)]
Disruptive changes in the design of a class of network nodes, e.g., the introduction of a new waveform. We refer to these as component changes.
\item[3)]
Disruptive changes in the system architecture, e.g., the introduction of new types of nodes or new functions in existing ones. We refer to these as architectural changes.
\item[4)]
Disruptive changes that have an impact at both the node and the architecture levels. We refer to these as radical changes.
\end{itemize}

We focus on disruptive (component, architectural or radical) technologies,%\cite{Burt1977Marine}
driven by our belief that the extremely higher aggregate data rates and the much lower latencies required by 5G cannot be achieved with a mere evolution of the status quo. We believe that the following five potentially disruptive technologies could lead to both architectural and component design changes, as classified in Figure\ref{fig:1}.\cite{Boccardi2014Five}
